title: Not a real engineer
---

> You are not a real engineer.
> You are a creature with a terrible countenance
> the stature of a man
> the head of an eagle
> with six wings about you
> and eyes uncountable, like burning torches
> the belt at your waist is a serpent
> with two heads and no tail
> your breath is the gathering of stormclouds
> your voice is the thundering of the wind
> the grass withers before your footsteps
> and your tongue is as black as shadow
> and brings apocalypse on everything it touches
> 
> Please be informed
> we will not be offering you the role at this time
> we're taking our chances with Bradwick
